Learn language easier with the help of AI.

Note from Matt:
GAH it is so hard to learn Korean. I've been studying Korean on and off for the past year so I can fully utilize it in my language toolbelt when I spend time this year in Korea with the in-laws for the holidays. I ramped up studying every morning for the past 2 months, and beyond just the vocab learning from Duolingo, and the grammar learning from TTMIK (Talk to Me in Korean), what has most helped me was writing things consistenly in sentences.

Writing an open sentence without a prompt, or without a specific intention is not easy. And that's why I spent my mornings asking myself how I can consistently write something, and reap the benefits of getting something else out of it at the same time. So, I decided I would take something I do every morning and force myself to do the same thing each day, but using Korean instead of English.

Each morning, I've decided to write what I'm grateful for in Korean. I take time to give thanks and remember my blessings, all while learning how to communicate that in Korean. Taking something I do in my everyday life and language-context-switch that to Korean has been tremendously effective. **To help me with this daily action, I've created this app which prompts the user to submit what they're grateful for in the form of a sentence, paragraph, or essay, and in response, return to the user corrections to their translation, and to suggest any other sentences that they can learn.** 

I encourage you to do the same with a language of your choice!
